My work is primarily focused on a project funded by the Government of India, allowing me to delve into the fascinating field of Automotive Radar. In this project, we utilize the Point Cloud-Based approach that leverages the power of 77 GHz FMCW Radar and Deep Learning for accurate posture classification. Currently, my efforts are directed towards using TinyML to implement this posture classification on embedded hardware, specifically, the Raspberry Pi. The technologies used in this project include FMCW Radar, Python, MATLAB, Deep Learning, TinyML, Raspberry Pi and others."

During this project, I was responsible for debugging and fixing front-end and back-end bugs hindering the websiteâ€™s functionality. After successful testing, the website was up and running smoothly. In addition to this, I developed DataShareHub, a full-stack website aimed at sharing and storing datasets. This web application was built using the MERN stack. I also developed a personalized e-learning chatbot model for elementary school children. For this, I used Llama2, an open-source Large Language Model (LLM), and fine-tuned it to meet our specific needs. The technologies I used throughout these projects include MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS, Thunder Client, and Large Language Model (LLM)."
